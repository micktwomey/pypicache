A PyPI cache, for those times when you're feeling down because PyPI is
down.

* Home: http://pypicache.readthedocs.org/
* Source: https://bitbucket.org/micktwomey/pypicache/

In source checkouts run "make" to get a list of actions.

**Note** If you are looking for a much more fully featured PyPI server use devpi_. I'm accepting pull requests but I'm not actively developing this server any more (my use cases are now fulfilled by devpi_).
